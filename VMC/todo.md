- [x] Work in log domain
- [x] Correct loss gradient in FermiNet style formula and implementation
- [x] Implement loss as in m*, in which the gradient is only calculated with Eloc but not Eloc - expectation_of_Eloc.
- [ ] Try to desing network with nodal features.
- [x] Change wave function ansatze into Fock Space.
