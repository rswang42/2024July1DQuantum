## Important update (2024-07-15)


By adding the feature to individually training one excited state (also enabling training ARBITRARY selected states), enable to accurately calculate each excitation state. NOTE: the best practice to train one excited state is to ONLY selecting this state, especially one needs to EXCLUDE ground state since the non-nodal feature of the GS would hinder the optimization of nodal excited states!
